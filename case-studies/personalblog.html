        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <p> The summer after my freshman year, I was a Lead Software Instructor at iD Tech Summer Camps at Emory University where I taught kids 
                aged 7-17 how to code using Python, Lua scripting, and Adobe Photoshop. However, during my off days, I still wanted to learn new technologies
                that I didn't have the chance to work with after my first-year at Brown. Therefore, I made it my goal that summer to create a personal project 
                that I could present on my resume while allowing me to explore new technologies that I haven't had the chance to use before.

    <!-- PART 1: DATA Collection  -->
    <section id="p1"class="p1">
        <h1 class="part1">Part 1: Research</h1>
        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <p>
                During my off days from work, there were a lot of different technologies that I was interested in.
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li class="sub-bullet">First, I was interested in potentially doing a project in sports analytics involving <span class="bold">machine learning</span> . 
                    As someone who has played soccer his whole life, I loved the idea of creating a project that would be an intersection between 
                    my interests in sports and computer science. However, after some thought, I thought this wouldn't be the best idea for this personal project 
                    during the summer. The reason is because I had to consider the audience that I wanted to appeal to. Not only did I want to make something that 
                    was interesting, but my primary audience that I wanted to appeal to was recruiters as recruiters would be the first people that would lay eyes on
                    my resume. 
                </li>
                <li class="sub-bullet">
                    Therefore, I wanted to make a <span class="bold">web application</span>, so that recruiters would be able to view the application with their own eyes to break down the technical 
                    barrier. Then, I began to ask myself, what should I make my theme for my application? Additionally, at the time, I had just finished reading James Clear's 
                    <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits" target="_blank">Atomic Habits</a> and was a big fan of his personal blog. Therefore, I made it my 
                    goal that summer to create a personal blog using technologies that I haven't used before while working 60+ hours a week as an instructor. Not only 
                    would this give me an avenue to write articles about topics that I enjoyed, but I would be exploring new technologies during the process. 
                </li>
                <li class="sub-bullet">
                    <span class="bold">Technologies</span>: Next, I needed to figure out what technologies to use for my personal blog. At the time (and probably still), I heard of 
                    this Javascript framework called React.js that was very popular. 
                    <div class="react-contain">
                        <img class="react-photo" src="../images/react.js.png">
                    </div>
                    Therefore, I primarily wanted to use React.js. Additionally, as someone who wanted to try out new 
                    styling packages, I decided on Tailwind CSS as my primary styling language. After searching online on what would be the best ways to store data, I decided on using 
                    GraphQL, Next.js, and Hygraph. Therefore, the technologies that I wanted to use would be the following: 
                    <ul>
                        <li class="sub-bullet">React.js</li>
                        <li class="sub-bullet">Next.js</li>
                        <li class="sub-bullet">GraphQL</li>
                        <li class="sub-bullet">Hygraph</li>
                        <li class="sub-bullet">Tailwind CSS</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="sub-bullet">With the technologies and the idea in mind, I started to begin the design process.</li>
            </ul>

    <!-- PART 2: CREATING HYPOTHESES -->
    <section id="p2" class="p2">
        <h1 class="part2">Part 2: Design Iterations</h1>
        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <h3 class="sub-section">Initial Design Sketches</h3> <br>
            <p>
                I had a strong vision for the design of the blog before implementing the code. I've included the sketches for my initial designs below:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="version-data-contain">
            <div class="versionA-data">
                <h3 class="sub-section">Main Homepage</h3>
                <img class="blog-photo" src="../images/blogsketch1.png">
            </div>
            <div class="versionB-data">
                <h3 class="sub-section">Specific Post</h3>
                <img class="blog-photo" src="../images/blogsketch2.png">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <p>
                As shown in my sketches above, I wanted the main layout of the my blog to include blog posts on the left hand side with a recent posts and 
                categories section on the right hand side for filtering of posts. Therefore, as you vertically scroll down, you can see previous posts that were 
                made. Then, if you are interested in specific categories or the most recent posts, then you can see those options on the side. 
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>However, I made some additional considerations after these initial sketches:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="sub-bullet">One additional consideration was providing some sort of security whenever a user makes a comment. Therefore, 
                    I thought it would be cool to have a system that whenever a user enters a comment, myself or an admin could approve that comment 
                    in the database, and only then will it be shown on the application. 
                    <ul>
                        <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">Tradeoff</span>: The tradeoff here was that if I implemented this additional layer of security, then 
                        the user wouldn't see their comment being posted right away, which is not as fun. However, I thought that the positive of additional security would 
                        outweigh this instant form of gratification to make sure that nobody could just comment anything on the website.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="sub-bullet">Another consideration was incorporating a carousel system at the top of the application in additional to the scroll-down-posts 
                    layout. I thought this could be cool to have the "most important posts" at the top of the screen: kind of like a news feed. 
                    <ul>
                        <li class="sub-bullet"><span class="bold">Tradeoff</span>: The potential negative here is that it could lead to clutter at the top 
                        of the screen; however, I thought it would be important to have a "most important" posts section analogous to a lot of media outlets, so I 
                        ultimately made the design to keep this design choice as well.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <h3 class="sub-section">Implementation Challenges</h3> <br>
            <p>
                One of my favorite parts was actually implmenting the design that I laid out for myself. However, here were some challenges that I 
                ran into while implementing: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="sub-bullet">First, the hardest part of the project for me was querying through GraphQL. It was a language that I've never really
                    used before, and it had a steep learning curve. Therefore, I had to spend a lot of time on YouTube and on Stack Overflow working on bugs and 
                    trying to find efficient ways to retrieve information from my Hygraph database. 
                </li>
                <li class="sub-bullet">Next, it was challenging learning all of the syntax for Tailwind CSS, and oftentimes my main React components 
                    would get extremely cluttered due to the amount of classnames there were. However, I thought it was a refreshing way to do CSS, and eventually 
                    I liked the way that it was ordered per component element rather than just nested in one large CSS file. 
                </li>
                <li class="sub-bullet">Finally, while React.js and Next.js was initially difficult to get used to eventually it started to become one of my 
                    favorite languages to use. Fastforward a couple of years, React.js is probably one of my favorite languages to code applications in, and I've used the 
                    language in both of my previous internships. 
                </li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>After implementing, my cover page looked something like this:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-contain">

        <h1 class="part3">Part 3: Solution</h1>
        <div class="context-paragraph">
            After implementing my design, I deployed my application to Vercel where it is still active to this day. Feel free to check it out 
            below!

            At the bottom of each page, you can also leave a comment to voice your opinion on my articles. As showcased above, it will need to be 
            approved by an admin on the backend, but you should soon be able to see your comment!

        <h1 class="part4">Part 4: Learnings</h1>
        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <p>There was so much that I learned from completing this project. First, I was able to learn new technologies that I haven't had the chance to 
                use before such as Next.js and GraphQL. Second, I was able to create a personal blog which is something that I was inspired to do based off 
                James Clear's own personal blog. Third, I was able to publish this application on my resume after the summer of the my freshman year, and as a junior 
                in college, it is still on my resume as one of my proudest projects. <br><br>Coincidentally, in the next semester after I returned to college, I received an email 
                from a local startup looking for a software engineer intern. Interested, as I looked at the qualifications for the role, I was surprised to find that the 
                "expected technologies" included React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS which were all technologies that I used for this project. During my interview process, 
                the developer mainly asked questions about my personal blog: the inspiration behind it as well as the design intuition that led to the creation of the application. 
                To my surprise, <span class="bold">we spent most of the thirty minute interview just talking about my blog</span>, and then a week later, I got the acceptance email for a software 
                engineer intern position at Siege. 
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>As a result, this project is one of my most favorite projects. Still in interviews to this day, I still talk about how this project with recruiters and developers alike. 
                The main takeaway that I've received is that in order to create a personal project, having a strong passion and idea before starting the implementation is key to staying motivated 
                as you never know what benefit a single project could have to your portfolio down the line.
